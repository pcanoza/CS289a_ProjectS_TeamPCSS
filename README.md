# CS289a ProjectS TeamPCSS - Ancient Egypt's Ptolemy
## Group: Sankar Srinivasan, Philip Canoza

Final Project S for CS 289a at UC Berkeley.  The project repository contains Jupyter Python notebooks that use astronomical data and machine learning techniques to find parameters inspired by Ptolemy's epicycle model of the heavens. Data generated is from Team SKEP, see here: https://github.com/pnelson6679/projectS_early_deadline_teamSKEP . We hope this project provides insight on how we can use modern numerical methods to understand and generalize the theories of ancient civilizations.

## FFT

## Regression
The regression folder contains a Jupyter notebook, regresssion_techniques.ipynb that uses linear regression techniques to learn positions of a geo-centric coordinate system of the heavens. The notebook also contains code for a simple regression to learn moon phases. Simply run the cells to perform the data-analysis.

## GIFs
Example GIFs to visualize the motion of the planets given this geocentric coordinate system and the epicycle model.  Also contained are examples of learned orbits.

## skep_data
CSV data generated from Team SKEPs early deadline project.
